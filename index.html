            <p>The load event is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as
                stylesheets, scripts,
                iframes, and images, except those that are loaded lazily. This is in contrast to DOMContentLoaded, which is
                fired as
                soon as the page DOM has been loaded, without waiting for resources to finish loading.
            </p>
            <p>Note: All events named load will not propagate to Window, even with bubbles initialized to true. To catch
                load events on
                the window, that load event must be dispatched directly to the window.

                Note: The load event that is dispatched when the main document has loaded is dispatched on the window, but
                has two
                mutated properties: target is document, and path is undefined. These two properties are mutated due to
                legacy
                conformance.</p>
            <p>
                Usage
                If any of your documentâ€™s event handlers depend on the document being fully loaded, you should check that it is loaded
                before executing those handlers. If the network connection were to stall out after a button appeared in the document but
                before the parts of the document that the button relied on were loaded, the user would get unintended behavior or an
                error message after clicking the button. One good way to verify that the document is loaded is to use the onload handler
                to set a variable -- loaded, for example -- to true and to check the value of this variable before doing anything that
                depends on the complete document being loaded.
